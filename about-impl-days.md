`impl Days` is a sibling event of RustFest&lt;Paris&gt;, sponsored by
Mozilla. `impl Days` is an open-ended time for Rust contributors to
collaborate in an active programming session.  It will take place on
the two days following the RustFest talks and workshops,
{{site.dates.impl_days_no_br}}.

## History

Back at RustFest<Zurich>, we organized two days after the conference
for open hacking and development. Since this was during the 2017 "impl
Period", the name "impl Days" was a natural choice.

<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-impl-period-newsletter-2/6034">
Over those two days</a>, 30 to 40 people came together to discuss, design,
and implement changes to Rust itself as well its broader ecosystem.

Plus, <a href="https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2017-10-02/?msg=91818378&page=2">they got to build a Lego Death Star</a>.

The Zurich `impl Days` was such a success that we decided to repeat
the event here in Paris.

## `impl Days` Paris

The event is being hosted at <a href="/location/#impl-days-may-28th-and-29th">{{site.location.impl_days}}</a>. 

`impl Days` is a great chance to work directly with other Rust
enthusiasts. The Rust project is supported by volunteers across the
globe, and while we often rely on github comments and IRC channels for
communication, the face-to-face communication enabled by an event like
this can be a big productivity boost.

You may be just starting out as a Rust contributor, or you may be a
long-time compiler hacker who reminisces about the days when Rust was
bootstrapped atop ML. Either way, there's plenty of tasks for all
contributors at `impl Days`.

You do not need to buy a separate ticket for `impl Days`; your Rust
Fest ticket will suffice. However, the `impl Days` venue,
<a href="/location/#impl-days-may-28th-and-29th">{{site.location.impl_days}}</a>,
is more limited in space than the main RustFest venue.

Thus, we are asking everyone who plans to attend `impl Days` to tell us,
via the button at the 
<a href="#sign_up_button">bottom of this page</a>

## What will happen at `impl Days`?

<a href="/people/pnkfelix">Felix Klock (pnkfelix)</a> will act as
coordinator, striving to aid participants in their efforts to
contribute to the Rust language, ecosystem, and community.

Felix requests that participants come to the Mozilla Paris office in
the morning between 9 and 9:30 AM. We will spend some time each
morning getting to know each other, and then identify tasks for
participants to collaborate on. There will be coffee provided at the
venue, and a break for a lunch at noon. Each of the two `impl Days`
will start winding down around 5 PM. All participants must, with heavy
hearts, vacate the Mozilla premises each day by 6 PM.

  * Of course all participants are free to arrive later and depart
    earlier than the times specified above.

  * We anticipate that some participants may even decide partway
    through the session that exploring the city of Paris is a more
    attractive way to spend their day than wrestling with Rust's
    borrow checker.

For ideas of what kinds of tasks we all might work on, check out the
blog post describing 
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2018/03/12/roadmap.html">Rust's roadmap for 2018</a>.

(We will make more detailed plans on-the-fly at `impl Days` itself,
based on the skill sets of the people who show up to contribute.)
