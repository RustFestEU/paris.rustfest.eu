`impl Days` is a sibling event of RustFest&lt;Paris&gt;, sponsored by
Mozilla. `impl Days` is an open-ended time for Rust contributors to
collaborate in an active programming session.  It will take place on
the two days following the RustFest talks and workshops,
{{site.dates.impl_days_no_br}}.

## History

Back at RustFest<Zurich>, we organized two days after the conference
for open hacking and development. Since this was during the 2017 "impl
Period", the name "impl Days" was a natural choice.

<a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/the-impl-period-newsletter-2/6034">
Over those two days</a>, 30 to 40 people came together to discuss, design,
and implement changes to Rust itself as well its broader ecosystem.

Plus, <a href="https://botbot.me/mozilla/rust-internals/2017-10-02/?msg=91818378&page=2">they got to build a Lego Death Star</a>.

The Zurich `impl Days` was such a success that we decided to repeat
the event here in Paris.

## `impl Days` Paris

The event is being hosted at <a href="/location/#impl-days-may-28th-and-29th">{{site.location.impl_days}}</a>. 

`impl Days` is a great chance to work directly with other Rust
enthusiasts. The Rust project is supported by volunteers across the
globe, and while we often rely on github comments and IRC channels for
communication, the face-to-face communication enabled by an event like
this can be a big productivity boost.

You may be just starting out as a Rust contributor, or you may be a
long-time compiler hacker who reminisces about the days when Rust was
bootstrapped atop ML. Either way, there's plenty of tasks for all
contributors at `impl Days`.

You do not need to buy a separate ticket for `impl Days`; your Rust
Fest ticket will suffice. **However**, the `impl Days` venue is
limited in space compared to the main RustFest venue, so we are asking
everyone who plans to attend `impl Days` to tell us:

to code at `impl Days` Paris!"</a>
