<p>This stream is HTML5 and doesn't track. There's an alternative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZPfmp7-H0">YouTube Live stream</a> that has a 4 hour buffer. Just in case you join late!</p> -->

<p>If you enjoy the stream, consider a <a href="https://ti.to/asquera-event-ug/rustfest-paris-2018/">Diversity Fund donation</a>. They will be used to fund people coming to the next conference!</p>

<p>Please be aware that the livestream is a best effort - with much love, but without guarantees. You can notify us at <a href="https://twitter.com/rustfest">@rustfest</a> if there are any issues.</p>

<p>Videos will be released soon after the conference.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.rrbone.net/">RRBone</a> and <a href="https://c3voc.de/">the C3VOC</a> for making this happen!</p>
