<h2>Livetime!</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://streaming.media.ccc.de/osc18/embed/main/dash/native" width="1024" height="576" frameborder="none" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" seamless="seamless" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>

<p>This stream is HTML5 and doesn't track. There's an alternative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_ZPfmp7-H0">YouTube Live stream</a> that has a 4 hour buffer. Just in case you join late.</p>

<p>Please be aware that the livestream is a best effort - with much love, but without guarantees. You can notify us at <a href="https://twitter.com/rustfest">@rustfest</a> if there are any issues.</p>

<p>Videos will be released soon after the conference.</p>

<p>Thank you to <a href="https://www.rrbone.net/">RRBone</a> and <a href="https://c3voc.de/">the C3VOC</a> for making this happen!</p>
