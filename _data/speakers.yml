    Henri started participating in the Mozilla project in 1999 and now works at Mozilla on the Gecko engine. In late 2012, as his first Rust project, he started porting Gecko's HTML parser, which he wrote, to Rust, but the project was abandoned due to a change in priorities. He returned to Rust post-1.0 to write the encoding_rs crate as a replacement of Gecko's previous character encoding conversion library.
