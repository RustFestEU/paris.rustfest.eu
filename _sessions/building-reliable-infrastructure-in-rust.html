title: Building Reliable Infrastructure in Rust
desc: >
  The wild success of testing tools like Jepsen is a wake-up call that we're approaching systems engineering from a fundamentally bug-prone perspective. Why don't we find these devastating bugs on our laptops before opening pull requests? Rust's compiler gives us wonderful guarantees about memory safety, but as soon as we open files or sockets, all hell seems to break loose.
  <br><br>
  This talk will show you how to apply techniques from the distributed systems and database worlds in a way that maximizes the number of bugs found per cpu cycle, and reduce the amount of bias that we hardcode into our tests.
