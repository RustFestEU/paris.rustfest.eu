title: Fixing bugs once and for all

desc: >
  Have you ever been annoyed at yourself for doing the same thing wrong again and again even though you know better? Here's your chance to do something about it.

  This workshop will teach you the basics of designing static analyses and the tools that help you doing so. The workshop will especially focus on designing and maintaining project specific static analyses, meaning lints that only help your project(s) and are not necessarily generally applicable.
