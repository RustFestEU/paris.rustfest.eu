title: A Rust+WebAssembly framework for client-side web apps
desc: >
  This is a talk about the architecture of [`yew`](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew) — a Rust framework for frontend development, inspired by _Elm_ and _ReactJS_ and designed for creating single-page webapps with Rust. You will get to know how it was created: wasm compilation issues, JSX-like templates created with a pure Rust macro, how lifetime rules helps to avoid copying of the model, and how to create a framework without a garbage collector to compete in the JavaScript world.
