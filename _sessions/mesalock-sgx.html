title: Bringing Intel SGX to the Rust Ecosystem
desc: >
  In this talk, we introduce Rust SGX SDK (future code name MesaLock SGX), which can protect secrets from most attacks by combining the power of Intel SGX and Rust.
  <br>
  Intel SGX is the next generation trusted computing technique supported in almost all recent Intel CPUs. It provides strong security guarantees and uses a completely different os/threading model, but lacks memory safety guarantees. We show how we ported Rust `std` and a series of fundamental and popular Rust crates into the Rust-SGX world. What's more, we support Xargo by providing a new target platform as `x86_64-unknown-linux-sgx`.
