title: Vector graphics rendering on the GPU in Rust with lyon
desc: >
  [`Lyon`](https://github.com/nical/lyon/) is a collection of low level tools to render 2D vector graphics on the GPU, useful for games as well as other applications benefiting from vector graphics (map renderers, web browsers, graphical user interfaces, creative coding, etc.).
  <br>
  This presentation will start with a very short overview of the type of functionalities lyon provides, followed by a deep dive into how lyon approaches rendering and how it relates to other GPU based vector graphics rendering tools.
