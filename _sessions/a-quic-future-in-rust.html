title: A QUIC future in Rust
desc: >
  Once HTTP/2 was standardized in 2015, the IETF started work on an even faster iteration of HTTP, based on QUIC: the Quick UDP Internet Connections protocol. The QUIC community is getting ever closer to standardizing it. While we have great HTTP and HTTP/2 implementations in Rust already, this talk discusses an effort to implement QUIC in pure Rust, based on the futures ecosystem.
