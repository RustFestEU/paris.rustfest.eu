title: "Tokio: How we hit 88mph"
keynote: true
desc: |
  Async I/O has forever been a hot topic of discussion in Rust, but over the
  past year we've seen some significant advances in this domain with the
  `futures` crate an the Tokio project. We'll start off by taking a look at
  where we are today with the async I/O ecosystem in Rust, highlighting a number
  of the features we've added in both the libraries and the language over the
  past year. We'll then take a deep dive into Tokio itself, seeing how it capitalizes
  on some of Rust's greatest strengths by going Back to Futures and
  gets our DeLorean up to 88mph.
